## Subagent & Memory Bank Discipline

For complex tasks, use `#runSubagent` to delegate to complementary agents. Ensure `memory-bank/` exists before work; read files in order: `projectbrief.md` → `activeContext.md` → `SESSION.md` → `README.md`. Log sessions as `YYYY-MM-DD — vX.Y.Z` in `SESSION.md`.
